# A Reproducible Workflow for Genetic Variant Calling Across Multiple Species

### Overview    
This repository contains the full workflow, configuration files, and processed outputs used for genetic variant discovery across diverse species. The pipeline follows a standardized, modular, and fully reproducible framework for transforming raw NGS reads into high-quality variant datasets (VCFs). It is designed to facilitate scientific research, ensure reproducibility, enable benchmarking, and support open data sharing.

└── docs/                  # Supplementary figures and data    

###  Scientific Motivation    
This project provides a transparent and reproducible pipeline for variant discovery across multiple species using parameterized workflows and curated datasets. All code and results are publicly available, enabling full reproducibility of the analyses presented in the associated manuscript.    

### Reproducibility    
This repository provides:    
- Full workflow scripts and parameters    
- Example datasets for pipeline testing    
- References to exact tool versions used
